/*                                   CLIENT                                   */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

- The CLIENT first checks for correct arguments. 
  Usage ./client <Hostname/IP Address> <Port> <Window Size> <Timeout(S)>"

-  The timeout input argument need to be in seconds. If the polling characteristic 
   times out, the client will check if there are any outgoing messages without acks, 
   and resend them all.

- It then reads input from the STDIN buffer and copy the value into the buffer till
  it detects newline character.

- Null character terminates the buffer, reset the index, add to the buffer and
  sequence string

- Each line of text should have a header added to it that includes a message 
  sequence number and added to a queue of messages. 

- If the number of messages that have been sent to the server and that are still 
  unacknowledged is less than the maximum sending window size, the message should 
  also be immediately sent to the server.

- A custom frame library has been implemented using linked list, which keeps track 
  of frame number. Our automated testing suite verifies the correctness of frame 
  library implementation.

- Instructions on running the client program is described briefly on README.md.

/*                                  SERVER                                    */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

- The server first checks for the proper arguments.

- It'll then bind to the port provided by input arguments, and sets up the file 
  descriptor for UDP communication. 

- If the connection fails, the server will exit. 

- The server then waits for a message.

- Each message should be is to the server in a separate UDP segment, according to 
  the rules of go-back-n sliding window.

- When your server gets a message from the client, if it is the next 
  in-order message.

- Server print it to our command line, together with its sequence number, 
  to stdout. 

- A probability function is used to simulate error injection.

- The server then prompts for and read a line of text from stdin.

- If a line of text beginning with “Y” is input, your server should consider 
  the message to have been correctly received; otherwise, your server should 
  consider the message to have been corrupted. 
 
- Server return an acknowledgement to the client (using UDP). 

- When the server gets a message from the client, and it is neither 
  the next in-order message nor a retransmission of the last correctly 
  received in-order message, the message should be printed to stdout 
  together with its sequence number, and an appropriate label indicating 
  that the message was out-of-order. 

- The server then does another receive call.

- When your server gets a message from the client, and it is a retransmission 
  of the last correctly received in-order message, the message is printed to 
  stdout together with its sequence number, and a label indicating it was 
  a retransmission.

- Instructions on running the server program is described briefly on README.md.

/*                                  FORWARDER                                 */
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

- Here, we implemented a forwarder that works with our client and server from 
  question 1. 

- The forwarder takes as command line arguments the port number it used for 
  receiving messages, the IP address of who the forwarder is forwarding to, i.e. the 
  “forwardee”, the port number that the forwardee will be using to receive messages, 
  the maximum sending window size that the forwarder will use for its outgoing 
  transmissions, and the timeout value (in seconds) that  is used to trigger 
  re-transmissions.
 
- The forwarder reads messages sent to it from either the client of question 1, or 
  from another forwarder process.

- Each new message should be processed in the same manner as the server of question 1 
  processes messages (e.g. same prints to stdout, same prompts for input from stdin). 

- If the message is the next in-order message and it has been considered to have been 
  successfully received (based on “Y” input from stdin), the message is added to queue
  of messages to be forwarded on. 

- For simplicity, we assume that through some connection establishment protocol. 
 
- The forwarder and forwardee have agreed on the initial sequence number value 
  that the forwarder will use (0).

- If the number of messages that have been sent to the forwardee and that are still 
  unacknowledged is less than the forwarder’s maximum sending window size, the message 
  should also be immediately sent to the forwardee.

- Each message should be sent to the forwardee in a separate UDP segment, according to
  the rules of go-back-n  sliding window. 

- Instructions on running the forwarder program is described briefly on README.md.
